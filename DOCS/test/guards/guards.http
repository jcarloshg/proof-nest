### Test public endpoint (should always succeed)
GET http://localhost:3000/public
Accept: application/json

### Test admin endpoint as non-admin (should fail with 403)
GET http://localhost:3000/admin
Accept: application/json

# ---
# To test as admin, edit src/application/guards/middleware/mock-user.middleware.ts
# Change: req.user = { roles: ['customer'] }
#   to:   req.user = { roles: ['admin'] }
# Then re-run the server and the /admin endpoint will return success.
