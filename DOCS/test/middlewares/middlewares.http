# ✅ Test cases for Logging (Request Enrichment) Middleware

### 1. Calls /test and checks the enriched property
GET http://localhost:3000/test
User-Agent: NestJS-HTTP-Test
Accept: application/json

### 2. Calls /health and confirms middleware is NOT called (x-request-id missing in logs)
GET http://localhost:3000/health
User-Agent: NestJS-HTTP-Test
Accept: application/json

### 3. Calls a random route to show generic middleware application
GET http://localhost:3000/anything
User-Agent: NestJS-HTTP-Test
Accept: application/json

#
# Expected:
# - /test: Should return `xRequestId` in the response body and see logs in server output
# - /health: Should NOT log via middleware (see server console)
# - /anything: Should log and enrich request (if a controller exists; else 404 with logs shown)
