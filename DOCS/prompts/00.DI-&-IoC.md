**Role:** Act as a Senior NestJS Backend Architect with deep expertise in Dependency Injection (DI) containers, SOLID principles, and TypeScript design patterns.

**Objective:** Create a comprehensive, production-ready NestJS module structure for a module named: `{{name_module}}` (located at `src/application/{{name_module}}`).

**Context:** We are building a scalable enterprise application. We need to demonstrate advanced Dependency Injection techniques to decouple our business logic from specific implementations.

**Task Requirements:**

1. **File Structure:** Generate the complete file tree and code for the module following standard NestJS architecture (DTOs, Interfaces, Services, Controllers, Modules).
2. **Advanced DI Implementation:**
   - **Custom Provider (`useClass`):** Create an abstract interface/class for a service (e.g., `INotificationService`) and implement it using a concrete class. Use `useClass` in the module to bind them.
   - **Dynamic Provider (`useFactory`):** Create a provider that requires dynamic configuration (e.g., reading an ENV variable to decide behavior). Inject dependencies into this factory.
   - **Circular Dependency Handling:** Create a brief, separate example or a commented section within the code showing exactly how to use `@Inject(forwardRef(() => OtherService))` to resolve a circular dependency between two services.

**Constraints & Best Practices:**

- STRICTLY follow NestJS best practices.
- Use explicit TypeScript types and Interfaces.
- Do not put all code in one block; separate it by file name.
- Include comments explaining _why_ a specific DI method (Factory vs Class) was chosen.

**Output Format:**

- Start with a generic File Tree structure.
- Follow with the code blocks for each file.
